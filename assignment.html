        <p>Over the three months, I had a number of "firsts" in my professional life.
            My first chance to put my academic knowledge to use in the real world came through an
            internship because academia can be pretty theoretical. Working on actual projects for
            a real organisation would not only help me build the skills necessary to work in the
            industry, but it will also instil confidence in my own ability and the interpersonal
            skills I need to work well with others. I believe that this experience has helped
            me mature and gain knowledge that I would not have obtained from university studies.
            The internship can assist me in determining whether or not a particular field or job is
            right for me and enable me to shorten the list of careers that I'm interested in in order
            to locate one that I'll enjoy. By taking part in an internship, I can see that even if
            I don't enjoy it, it will at the very least have helped me decide that a particular field
            isn't for me, so I can make better decisions about my future carrier.</p>

        <p>It's crucial to spend time with each department while working there,
            so I learned about how to work inside the industry. The opportunity
            to ask questions during an internship is quite important because it is a significant
            learning experience. The team members have been glad to educate me on issues and
            procedures that are used in our business that I was previously unaware of. Overall,
            I have acquired new abilities, resources, and information necessary to launch my
            professional career.
            Working in an office setting aids in developing the professionalism required to
            succeed in the corporate sector. I was able to learn about teamwork and communication
            and see how professionals communicate with one another by sitting in on presentations,
            and meetings.Through contact with members of the team and participation in a company
            meetings, I have been able to expand my professional network. I treasured my interactions
            with each person since I think it's critical to comprehend their other positions inside
            the organisation. Additionally, attending corporate gatherings helped me build my
            professional network. I realise that the internship was very helpful due to it helped me
            get closer to my career goals by bridging the knowledge gap between learning and getting
            a job.

        <p>This experience gives me the chance to test out a career with low stakes, which enables me
            to make better judgments about what I want to do with my life. An internship is a
            tried-and-true method of enhancing my resume. Employers-to-be will pay close attention
            to my internship-related abilities and experience, as well as the references I provide
            from industry experts. When I look for a job, the work samples that I get during an
            internship would be helpful as well. Moreover, internships facilitated my socialisation.
            I met new people with different cultures and personalities and expand my social network which can
            effect my social life.
