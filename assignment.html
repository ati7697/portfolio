        <h2 class="font-bold">Describe</h2>
        <p>In these 12 weeks, I learn and gain new experience. I work on 2 main projects.
            One involved creating a portfolio using Laravel and PHP, while the other involved
            creating the home page of a website for a company project. Company porject
            is about game based website that teach Laravel. By doing the project I learned new software app
            and gained new skill. Along the way, I received insightful criticism for my work from other
            team members, and I also provided them with comments. At every meeting, we discussed our
            ideas, our project, the progress, and the issues we were facing and try finding solutions.
            An internship throws my abilities to the test, whether it is by teaching me hard skills
            like how software functions or developing soft skills like communication and problem-solving.
            I faced challenges in the form of tiny, duties as well as some accountability. All of this
            is intended to make me more knowledgeable.</p>
    </div>



    <div class="m-8 space-y-5">
        <h2 class="font-bold">Interpret</h2>
        <p>Over the three months, I had a number of "firsts" in my professional life.
            My first chance to put my academic knowledge to use in the real world came through an
            internship because academia can be pretty theoretical. Working on actual projects for
            a real organisation would not only help me build the skills necessary to work in the
            industry, but it will also instil confidence in my own ability and the interpersonal
            skills I need to work well with others. I believe that this experience has helped
            me mature and gain knowledge that I would not have obtained from university studies.
            The internship can assist me in determining whether or not a particular field or job is
            right for me and enable me to shorten the list of careers that I'm interested in in order
            to locate one that I'll enjoy. By taking part in an internship, I can see that even if
            I don't enjoy it, it will at the very least have helped me decide that a particular field
            isn't for me, so I can make better decisions about my future carrier.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="m-8 space-y-5">
        <h2 class="font-bold">Evaluate</h2>
        <p>It's crucial to spend time with each department while working there,
            so I learned about how to work inside the industry. The opportunity
            to ask questions during an internship is quite important because it is a significant
            learning experience. The team members have been glad to educate me on issues and
            procedures that are used in our business that I was previously unaware of. Overall,
            I have acquired new abilities, resources, and information necessary to launch my
            professional career.
            Working in an office setting aids in developing the professionalism required to
            succeed in the corporate sector. I was able to learn about teamwork and communication
            and see how professionals communicate with one another by sitting in on presentations,
            and meetings.Through contact with members of the team and participation in a company
            meetings, I have been able to expand my professional network. I treasured my interactions
            with each person since I think it's critical to comprehend their other positions inside
            the organisation. Additionally, attending corporate gatherings helped me build my
            professional network. I realise that the internship was very helpful due to it helped me
            get closer to my career goals by bridging the knowledge gap between learning and getting
            a job.
        </p>

    <div class="m-8 mb-16 space-y-5">
        <h2 class="font-bold">Plan</h2>
        <p>This experience gives me the chance to test out a career with low stakes, which enables me
            to make better judgments about what I want to do with my life. An internship is a
            tried-and-true method of enhancing my resume. Employers-to-be will pay close attention
            to my internship-related abilities and experience, as well as the references I provide
            from industry experts. When I look for a job, the work samples that I get during an
            internship would be helpful as well. Moreover, internships facilitated my socialisation.
            I met new people with different cultures and personalities and expand my social network which can
            effect my social life.

        <h2 class="font-bold">Tailwind</h2>
        <p>The plan for the 12 weeks of the internship program was about 6 weeks of learning Laravel with the
            Bootcamp website and making a portfolio by Laravel and PHP. Bootcamp is an educational website. This
            website is created by Coding Labs company and provides for us to learn Laravel Framework.
            For the rest of the weeks, we worked on the company project.
            <br>
            We needed to use Tailwind CSS to develop pages. I had experienced working with Laravel, and PHP, and I did assignments for university.
            This experience helps me a lot during the internship and caused my progress to get faster. so, I finished the portfolio project
            2 weeks earlier than the due date.
            <br>
            I had never used Tailwind before, so learning how to use it was a new skill for me. I had no trouble using
            Tailwind CSS to create my website, and I felt very comfortable while working with it, and I understand that
            working with this framework is easier than with bootstrap or other frameworks. In any section where I had a problem or challenge, the other team
            members helped me, and together we found a solution. If I want to create a unique design,
            I still need to practice with this framework and develop more expertise. In addition, I'll use this framework going forwards
            for my future project.
            <br>
            The images below shows my work with Tailwind CSS.

    <div class="m-8 mb-16 space-y-5">
        <h2 class="font-bold">Blender</h2>
        <p>The company project is about a game based on the website. Blender is being used to
            create the game's characters and environment. Blender is an open-source 3D creation tool used for
            modelling. Using Blender is my first experience, and I hadn't worked with the application. I feel that the blender
            is a little bit challenging for me because it is a new environment, and that is not related to the programming. So,
            I need to work more and take more time to become an expert and make a professional model.
            <br>
            I looked at the YouTube tutorial on how to use the software and I created a simple donut. Unfortunately, I was unable to complete
            the tutorial because of a shortage of time. But I'll continue to work with Blender and develop my skills.

    <div class="m-8 mb-16 space-y-5">
        <h2 class="font-bold">Unity</h2>
        <p>The business is using Unity to publish the game on the website. Unity is a cross-platform
            game engine. Likewise to Blender, I had no prior knowledge of Unity. I thus begin learning
            it by watching tutorials on YouTube, visiting the Unity website, and asking for assistance
            from other team members.
            <br>
            I created a small Mario-style game for practise where the player may move and jump around
            and collect coins. For any movement of a character or having sound in the game or any changes
            that going to happen in the game, there will be writing code and programming with C#.
            So, C# is used with Unity. C# is an object-oriented, and type-safe programming language.
            Although I had never worked with C# before, I found it to be no issue because all programming
            languages have a similar writing style. And I found it simple to learn C#.
            I learned C# by visiting the W3school website and watching YouTube tutorials.
            <br>
            I liked working with Unity because of how programming and Unity are related.
            I will therefore continue to utilise Unity and accept any projects involving
            this programme. I must consequently sharpen my skills and practise more.

        <h1 class="flex font-bold text-2xl justify-center">Evidence my approach to continuous learning</h1>
        <p>
           My major in undergraduate was different. I studied urban planning, but when I was a bachelor's student, my method of learning new skills was totally different. I had to learn GIS, Photoshop, and 3Dmax for my bachelor's degree. I didn't use YouTube videos at the time to learn these applications, instead, I only took the course materials in class. I wasn't very good at finding information online, so I only became better by going over the course materials again. But for the master, I adjust my approach to sharpen my abilities. I make an effort to search for various materials using various methods. I can learn more effectively and quickly pick up new abilities due to this approach. In addition, the new way I learn skills and develop them at work makes it much easier for me to work on projects, get better outcomes, and go above and beyond what the company expects.
            <br>
            while I was studying for my bachelor, when I issued a problem or challenge I didn't know how to solve problems but in my master, My viewpoint on issues and challenges has changed, and I've learned how to look for solutions to problems and how to address challenges. There are always issues and challenges at work due to the various projects that may arise, and one of the key things is to first recognise the issue before attempting to solve it.
            <br>
            Working together as a team and communicating effectively are key. Since most projects involve teams and members from various cultural backgrounds and personality types, effective teamwork depends on effective communication. People from a different department may also be involved in a project, and effective communication between them is crucial. While I had worked in a team with other students for my bachelor's, I had no prior experience working a job or interacting with coworkers in an office setting.
            However, the internship program allows me the opportunity to work in a professional setting and gain experience communicating with team members. Additionally, having experience with group projects for my bachelor's and master's degrees has helped me communicate more effectively.        </p>

        <h1 class="flex font-bold text-2xl justify-center">Extra-curricular experience</h1>
        <p>
            I did a Web Design Experts course at the Roshdana institution before moving to Australia. I make a page with Html and Bootstrap framework. I had no experience with designing before I enrolled in the course. At the time, using Bootstrap to create designs wasn't simple for me. And because I was having problems, I enrolled in a course. I became familiar with Bootstrap by watching videos on YouTube, doing exercises, and creating various homepage designs.
            In this course I learn how to make a responsive page for other devices such as mobile phones and tablet.
